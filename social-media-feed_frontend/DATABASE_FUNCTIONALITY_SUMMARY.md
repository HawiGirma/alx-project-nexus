# Database and GraphQL Functionality Summary

## Overview

I've successfully enhanced your social media feed application with comprehensive database functionality and GraphQL API improvements. Here's a detailed breakdown of what has been added and improved.

## Database Schema Enhancements

### New Models Added

#### 1. Follow Model

```prisma
model Follow {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  followerId  String
  followingId String
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())

  // Relations
  follower  User @relation("UserFollowing", fields: [followerId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  following User @relation("UserFollowers", fields: [followingId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@unique([followerId, followingId])
  @@map("follows")
}
```

#### 2. Notification Model

```prisma
model Notification {
  id        String           @id @default(cuid())
  type      NotificationType
  userId    String
  actorId   String
  postId    String?
  commentId String?
  read      Boolean          @default(false)
  createdAt DateTime         @default(now())

  // Relations
  user    User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  actor   User @relation("NotificationActor", fields: [actorId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  post    Post? @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  comment Comment? @relation(fields: [commentId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@map("notifications")
}
```

#### 3. New Enums

```prisma
enum NotificationType {
  LIKE_POST
  LIKE_COMMENT
  COMMENT
  FOLLOW
  SHARE
}
```

### Updated Relations

- Added follow relationships to User model
- Added notification relationships to User, Post, and Comment models
- Enhanced data integrity with proper foreign key constraints

## GraphQL API Enhancements

### New Queries Added

#### 1. User Management

- `userByUsername(username: String!)` - Find user by username
- `searchUsers(query: String!, first: Int)` - Search users by name, username, or bio

#### 2. Content Discovery

- `searchPosts(query: String!, first: Int)` - Search posts by content

#### 3. Notifications

- `notifications(first: Int, unreadOnly: Boolean)` - Get user notifications

### New Mutations Added

#### 1. Content Management

- `deletePost(postId: ID!)` - Delete a post (author only)
- `deleteComment(commentId: ID!)` - Delete a comment (author only)

#### 3. Notification Management

- `markNotificationRead(notificationId: ID!)` - Mark specific notification as read
- `markAllNotificationsRead` - Mark all notifications as read

### New Subscriptions

- `notificationAdded` - Real-time notifications for new likes, comments, and follows

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. User Following System

### 2. Comment Liking System

- Users can like/unlike comments
- Like counts and status tracking

- Only content authors can delete their own content
- Cascade deletion maintains data integrity

### 4. Search Functionality

### 5. Notification System

- Real-time notifications for:
  - Post likes
  - Comment likes
  - New comments

  - Post shares
- Read/unread status tracking
- Bulk notification management

### 6. Enhanced Data Integrity

- Proper foreign key relationships
- Cascade deletion for data consistency
- Unique constraints to prevent duplicates
- Optimized queries with proper indexing

## GraphQL Operations Added

### Queries

```graphql
# User search and profile
userByUsername(username: String!): User
searchUsers(query: String!, first: Int): [User!]!
userPosts(userId: ID!, first: Int, after: String): PostConnection!

# Content search
searchPosts(query: String!, first: Int): [Post!]!

# Notifications
notifications(first: Int, unreadOnly: Boolean): [Notification!]!
```

### Mutations

```graphql
# Content management
deletePost(postId: ID!): Boolean!
deleteComment(commentId: ID!): Boolean!

# Social interactions
likeComment(commentId: ID!): Comment!
unlikeComment(commentId: ID!): Comment!
followUser(userId: ID!): User!
unfollowUser(userId: ID!): User!

# Notifications
markNotificationRead(notificationId: ID!): Notification!
markAllNotificationsRead: Boolean!
```

### Subscriptions

```graphql
notificationAdded: Notification!
```

## Database Status

- ✅ Database schema updated and synchronized
- ✅ All new models created with proper relationships
- ✅ Sample data seeded successfully
- ✅ GraphQL types regenerated
- ✅ All resolvers implemented and tested

## Performance Optimizations

- Proper database indexing for search queries
- Efficient pagination with cursor-based navigation
- Optimized queries with selective field loading
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates

## Security Features

- Authorization checks for content deletion
- User isolation for notifications
- Proper data validation and error handling
- Prevention of self-following and duplicate actions

## Next Steps

The database and GraphQL API are now fully functional with comprehensive social media features. You can:

1. **Test the API** using the GraphQL playground at `/api/graphql`
2. **Integrate with frontend** using the generated TypeScript types
3. **Add authentication** to replace the mock user system
4. **Implement file uploads** for media attachments
5. **Add more advanced features** like hashtags, mentions, or direct messages

The foundation is solid and ready for production use with proper authentication and deployment configuration.
